  - Server starts successfully on port 8000
  - No startup errors
  - Logs show proper initialization

### ✅ 3. Swagger UI
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:**
  - Accessible at http://localhost:8000/docs
  - Interactive documentation loads correctly
  - All endpoints visible and documented

### ✅ 4. LangGraph Server
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:**
  - Server runs on port 8123
  - Health endpoint responds correctly
  - Returns: `{"status": "healthy", "server": "langgraph"}`

### ✅ 5. Remote Model Connectivity
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:**
  - **Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct:** Successfully accessible at E2E Networks endpoint
  - **Whisper-large-v3:** Successfully accessible at E2E Networks endpoint
  - Both models respond to API calls with proper authentication

### ✅ 6. Audio Transcription Endpoint (`/transcribe`)
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:**
  - Accepts audio file upload
  - Creates job successfully
  - Returns job ID for tracking
  - Job status: `queued`

### ✅ 7. Text Summarization Endpoint (`/summarize`)
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:**
  - Accepts text input
  - Creates summarization job
  - Returns job ID
  - Supports both direct text and job_id reference

### ⚠️ 8. Combined Workflow Endpoint
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Details:**
  - `/workflow/transcribe-and-summarize` endpoint not found
  - This appears to be planned for future implementation
  - Current workflow requires separate calls to transcribe and summarize

### ✅ 9. Job Tracking System (`/jobs/{id}`)
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:**
  - Jobs are persisted to file system
  - Job status can be queried
  - Includes timestamps and full job details

### ✅ 10. GitHub Integration
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:**
  - Code successfully pushed to repository
  - SSH key configured for project-specific authentication
  - Repository accessible at: https://github.com/namm9an/Agent-T-S

## Available Endpoints

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Jobs are queued and processed asynchronously
2. **File-based Persistence**: Jobs stored as JSON files for simplicity
3. **Remote Model Integration**: No local models - all use E2E Networks endpoints
4. **Swagger Documentation**: Full API documentation available
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
6. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between FastAPI and LangGraph

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Job Processing**: Jobs remain in "queued" status - actual model processing may need additional configuration
2. **Combined Workflow**: The combined transcribe+summarize endpoint is not implemented
3. **Callback System**: Callback endpoint exists but actual webhook implementation needs testing
4. **Wait Parameter**: Synchronous waiting for job completion needs verification

## Recommendations

1. **Test with Real Audio**: Test with actual speech audio files
2. **Monitor Job Processing**: Verify that jobs transition from "queued" to "completed"
3. **Implement Combined Workflow**: Add the `/workflow/transcribe-and-summarize` endpoint
4. **Add Authentication**: Implement API key authentication for production
5. **Setup CI/CD**: Add GitHub Actions for automated testing
6. **Add Unit Tests**: Implement pytest test cases
7. **Docker Deployment**: Create Dockerfile for containerized deployment

## Conclusion

The Agent T+S project has been successfully set up with:
- ✅ Working FastAPI server with documentation
- ✅ LangGraph orchestration server
- ✅ Remote model connectivity to E2E Networks
- ✅ File-based job tracking system
- ✅ GitHub repository with SSH authentication

The system is ready for further development and testing with real transcription and summarization workloads.

## Next Steps

1. Test with real audio containing speech
2. Verify end-to-end workflow execution
3. Monitor model response times and accuracy
4. Implement production-ready features (auth, monitoring, etc.)
5. Deploy to cloud infrastructure
